Title: Air Quality Across Countries in COVID-19

##### INTRODUCTION:
This project examines air quality's impact on health, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Air pollution is a significant environmental issue, primarily caused by pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O3). These pollutants contribute to the air quality index (AQI), a measure used by government agencies to communicate air pollution levels to the public. Exposure to high levels of air pollution can lead to numerous health issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. We analyze the AQI across seven countries (Brazil, India, Italy, France, the United States, Canada, and China) during the COVID-19 pandemic period (2019-Q4 to 2022-Q4). This study aims to investigate whether there was a trend in AQI affecting the number of COVID-19 cases in each country, thus deepening our understanding of the relationship between human activities and air pollution.

##### GUIDING QUESTIONS:
Our investigation was guided by four main questions:

How was AQI distributed across countries during COVID (2019-Q4 to 2022-Q4)?
Which countries experienced a rise in AQI during the sampled duration, and which country and city had the highest pollution level?
What factors influenced AQI, and what is the correlation between different pollutants and AQI?
Was there a relationship between AQI and COVID-19 cases in each country during the pandemic?

##### METHODOLOGY:
The study relied on two data sources: the Air Quality Open Data Platform and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 data on Kaggle. The data was preprocessed, including merging the data from the two sources, dropping unnecessary columns, and checking for missing values. We then calculated the AQI for each pollutant based on the US-EPA 2016 standard.

##### RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:
The analysis revealed that pollutant levels significantly impact the AQI, with PM2.5 being the most influential. We also found a correlation between the COVID-19 pandemic and air quality. Specifically, air quality seemed to improve during periods of lockdowns and travel restrictions. The scatter plot of AQI vs. cumulative COVID cases over time indicates a relationship between COVID-19 and air quality.

Unfortunately, despite being a significant environmental concern, air pollution only receives a tiny fraction of global development aid. We hope that our analysis raises awareness about the importance of reducing AQI levels. Our findings can assist policymakers and environmental organizations in developing targeted measures to improve air quality and reduce pollution levels in the most affected areas.

##### FUTURE SCOPE AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
While our study has provided significant insights, more extensive research is needed to understand better the interrelationship between air quality and COVID-19 transmission and identify effective strategies for reducing both's impact. This could include controlled experiments or multivariate analysis to establish a causal relationship. Other factors, such as population density, public health measures, and socioeconomic status, should also be considered in future studies.
